# EARTH | Citizen
## Knowledge sharing

Have been in and out of web-based learning for a couple of years.
Most recently I have undertaken react as a front end framework, this
was taken on as a +1 to the utility belt, but also to build dApps
using Blockchain and cryptocurrency as the method of
communication.
Coming from a technical mindset, I understand what can make
systems better, but lack the experience and team size to actually
create those systems.
Looking to be placed in a work environment thatâ€™ll allow the
continuation of knowledge building and have began working on
directly understanding backend languages (Node, Golang).

# DSX | Research Intern
## digitalstock.exchange

My introduction into the Blockchain ecosystem. My time at DSX
was spent researching and understanding how the movement of
crypto-currencies and tokenised assets are going to revolutionise
the future.
This first real role allowed me to understand the ecosystem as a
whole, but also the foundation for understanding the benefits of
platforms like Ethereum.

# Currently 
Partaking in multiple projects that are associated with crypto-currency and blockchains. Looking for the intersection point between the physical and the virtual world, whilst increasing the knowledge about it. 

Ideally, looking for a position that will allow me to learn and grow, whilst making an impact at the same time.
