## Currently Learning
When life throws you speed bumps, you encounter general inefficiencies in how something is operating.
Those direct problems have turned me towards developing a better foundation and goals are;

Short
- Front End (React)

Medium
- Material Design

Long
- Backend (Golang/Python TBD)

## Parsl | Community Manager
I am currently working for a startup in Melbourne called Parsl, which whilst at times has been extremely challenging and demanding, has proven to be a tremendous character-building experience.
I am enjoy working with Startups given my interest in virtual currencies, alongside my continued enthusiasm for the growing Blockchain industry, specifically EOSio.

## Samsung | Brand Ambassador
As a Brand Ambassador, I was directly placed in Telstra to essentially welcome customers to the suite of Samsung products available. I was constantly mentoring and providing information about Samsung products to Telstra employees and motivating other Samsung colleagues to reach their targets.
