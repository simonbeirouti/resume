# Personal attributes

<br />

My early exposure to logistics and different forms of product movement and data input and output has motivated me to pursue a career in data analytics and software engineering. I value the benefit of technology in increasing productivity and efficiency in the workplace and facilitating convenience and informative living. I have recognised how this can benefit internal processes and decision making.

I continue developing exceptional customer service, communication and multi-tasking skills in my roles by taking on challenges and pushing my boundaries. I have also built upon my abilities to perform under pressure, persevere and stay resilient, commit to excellence by constantly improving, goal-setting, leadership and teamwork, and time management.
